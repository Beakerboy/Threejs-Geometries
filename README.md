Threejs Geometries

 * [PyramidGeometry](https://beakerboy.github.io/Threejs-Geometries/geometry-browser.html#PyramidGeometry) Extrude an arbitrary shape to a point. Combining aspects of ExtrudeGeometry and ConeGeometry.
 * [RampGeometry with depth](https://beakerboy.github.io/Threejs-Geometries/geometry-browser.html#RampGeometry_depth) Extrude an arbitrary shape to a slope given a depth and direction.
 * [RampGeometry with pitch](https://beakerboy.github.io/Threejs-Geometries/geometry-browser.html#RampGeometry_pitch) Extrude an arbitrary shape to a slope given a direction and pitch.
 * [WedgeGeometry](https://beakerboy.github.io/Threejs-Geometries/geometry-browser.html#WedgeGeometry) Take an arbitrary shape, "bend it" along a line, and stretch each slope to have the same maximum depth. Esetially, create a gabled roof from an overhead view of the outline, and the height of the roof.
